# Loan Default Risk Prediction-
CS7641 Project

## Abstraction
Our project focused on loan default risk detection. In detail, we used machine learning approach to predict whether an applicant will repay his loan or not. 

Predicting loan default risk is an essential problem for financial institutions. Good predictions will not only empower trustworthy clients to be successful by providing loans, but also help financial institutions control business risk. The dataset we used is from Kaggle, a real business dataset provided by Home Credit. 

Another motivation for our project is that we plan not only use the techniques learned in classes, like logistic regression and random forest, but also try some other popular approach, like gradient boosting. Boosting is an ensemble learning approach that a sequence of models are learned aiming at decreasing the bias of previous weak models. The core algorithm of Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) is regarding the whole fitting function as the parameter and calculating the gradient descent upon the loss function. Many research showed that GBM outperformed in classification problems. So we will experiment with gradient boosting to see how it performs in our case.
